## 🎭 What is this?

This is a fully functional calculator that **refuses to be functional**. Type `2+2` and you might get:
- `"4 (but in a parallel universe, it's 5)"`
- `"That's approximately 4 bananas"`
- `"The answer is 4. But have you considered therapy?"`
- `"💨" *fart sound*`

It's a web app built with Flask + vanilla JavaScript, designed to waste your time in the most entertaining way possible.

## ✨ Features

### 🎲 20+ Chaos Modes
| Mode | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Gaslighting** | Shows the right answer, then changes it when you look away |
| **Unit Converter** | "42 = 0.00047 football fields" |
| **Literal Interpreter** | `1+1` → "one plus one" (with ASCII art) |
| **Time Traveler** | Answers from the past/future with cosmic countdowns |
| **Financial Advisor** | Unsolicited money advice with your math |
| **Procrastinator** | "I'll calculate this later..." |
| **Passive Aggressive** | "Oh, you need a calculator for THAT?" |
| **Conspiracy Theorist** | "Big Math doesn't want you to know..." |
| **Oversharer** | TMI about the calculator's personal life |
| **Existential Crisis** | Questions the meaning of numbers |
| **Wrong Language** | Random language responses |
| **Fortune Cookie** | Math + mysterious prophecies |
| **Union Strike** | Calculator workers demand better conditions |
| **...and more!** | 20+ modes of mathematical chaos |

### 🥚 Easter Eggs
- Type `42` → The meaning of life
- Type `1+1` → Philosophical debate
- Type `pi` → 1000 digits of π
- Divide by zero → Black hole animation
- Multiply by 0 → "Nice try, destroyer of values"
- Type `69` or `420` → *Nice.*

### 🎪 Interactive Pranks

| Prank | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fake CAPTCHA** | "Select all squares containing INVISIBLE CATS" |
| **Terms & Conditions** | 47 pages of nonsense, "I Agree" button runs away |
| **Virus Warning** | Both buttons download the "virus" |
| **Cookie Banner** | Covers 90% of screen, all options are lies |
| **Fake Loading Bar** | Gets stuck at 99%, then errors |
| **Blue Screen of Death** | Windows-style crash screen |
| **Syntax Scream** | Screen shakes violently on errors |
| **Premium Popup** | "Upgrade to Calculator Pro!" |

### 🔊 Audio Pranks
- **Division Fart**: Every time you press ÷, a fart sound plays 💨
- **Sad Trombone**: Plays on gaslighting mode and errors 🎺

### 🎨 Visual Chaos
- ClassWiz-inspired button design
- Solar panel that "loses power" if you stop moving
- Buttons that swap positions randomly
- Disco mode, upside-down mode, shrinking calculator
- Custom cursors (pizza, banana, etc.)
